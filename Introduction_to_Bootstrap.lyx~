\begin_layout Section
Getting Started with Bootstrap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During our first module we'll cover the basics of Bootstrap and the grid
 system.
 You'll see how to obtain and add Bootstrap to your pages, and why Bootstrap
 makes developing responsive pages simpler than using CSS directly.
 We'll also explain how the grid system works to layout your pages.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bootstrap Classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most everything that you want to add onto a page by using Bootstrap is done
 by adding classes and HTML to the page.
 There are numerous Bootstrap classes.
 Fortunately, you don't have to know or memorize all of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many of the classes are related to one another, so learning the basic concepts
 of what makes up certain classes is all that's needed.
 There are many that are pretty straight forward, such as left and right,
 which will do exactly what you expect.
 And there are still others which you may never find yourself using, which
 is just fine.
 You will notice that the goal of this course is not to teach you every
 Bootstrap class that's available, but rather how to use Bootstrap in your
 applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As has already been stated, Bootstrap uses CSS.
 This means you are free to customize all classes as needed by using standard
 CSS and cascading rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Common Bootstrap Starting Classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When putting together the layout for a page, there are a few classes that
 you typically use to start.
 The first two help define how much space the content will take on the overall
 page, while the last will allow you to highlight content, such as the site's
 title and introductory information.

The container class places content inside of a horizontal container.
 The size of the container will vary based on screensize.
 The container will stay the same width for that particular screensize.
 This helps developers size content appropriately for different devices.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bootstrap Grid System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many web developers have used tables to layout pages.
 Tables made it easier for the web developer, because the developer didn't
 have to worry about either the complexities of CSS, or cross-browser issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, while tables may have made it easier for the developer, it
 makes it more of a challenge for both web browsers and accessibility.
 For traditional browsers, complex table structures can degrade the performance
 of page layout.
 For screen readers, tables are read assume tabular data, which may not
 be how the page is actually layed out and designed to be presented to the
 user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this in mind, it is never a best practice to do page layout using tables.
 Bootstrap offers a grid system so developers don't feel the urge to layout
 pages using tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bootstrap grid behaves like a table.
 There are rows and columns.
 However, unlike tables, Bootstrap uses CSS to manage the layout of the
 pages.
 In addition, Bootstrap offers support for mobile browsers and different
 sized screens by providing different grids for different screen sizes.
 There are four screensizes provided by Bootstrap grids.
 This allows developers to size content appropriately for various devices.
\end_layout

 by a setting specific to one of the larger sizes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate-Resume
There is a 30px "gutter", or empty space, between each column (15px on each
 side of the column) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate-Resume
The gutter on the outside of the container varies based on the current screen
 size 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Extra small devices always use the entire width of the screen

Lab Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Labs are designed to both be a challenge as well as real-world.
 As a result, full step-by-step instructions are not provided.
 However, all of the needed information, class names, and resources to complete
 the labs have been provided.
 This content is either in the videos provded, or in the resources section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you do get stuck you are free to discuss the lab with other students.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keep in mind that future labs will continue to build on this one.
 Successful completion of the labs will require completing the labs from
 the module prior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Lab Steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each lab will provide various resources.
 As you attempt the lab, try to solve the lab by using the earliest step
 possible.
 Here are the resources provided for this lab:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Wireframe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the real world, a wireframe is generated to represent the design the
 business owner desires.
 Being able to translate a wireframe into a final product is a key skill
 all web developers need to have.
 Remember, a wireframe does not need to be matched exactly; a wireframe
 is intended to be a rough sketch of the desired result.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate-Resume
Screenshot 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're just getting started, or if the wireframe isn't clear about the
 target design, you can look at the screenshot.
 This is a sample of what the final result should look like.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate-Resume
Additional guidance

\begin_layout Standard
The additional guidance is provided to add clarity and help add context
 if needed.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Lab Scenario
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have been tasked with creating a page to display the details of a record
 album.
 You will build this page up over the course of the next several labs.
 The starting page only needs to target medium and large devices; support
 for smaller devices will be added later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are the necessary components:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A banner to display the name of the music store, Music Store 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Album information 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An image on the left side to represent the cover art.
 The image is provided here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The basic information on the album on the right side.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, you have been requested to implement a new theme that is different
 from the default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You are free to choose whatever theme you like, and are free to determine
 the sizing that you believe will work best for the page.

\begin_layout Section
Page Design and Data Display
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bootstrap offers several features to ensure your page is designed optimally
 for all screen sizes.
 You'll examine how to best use those capabilities to ensure users can easily
 consume the data they need regardless of their device type.
 You'll also see how to use some of the advanced components, or controls,
 that Bootstrap offers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Forms and User Interaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll close our exploration of Bootstrap by taking a look at how we can
 obtain data from the user and provide feedback.
 Bootstrap offers great support for customizing forms, and several options
 to let the user know when the form is correct or incorrect.
 You'll see how to add alerts and modal dialog boxes, as well as inline
 validation and data prompts.
